This survey system should function reasonably when run using script/server.

It depends on sqlite3.

To use conditional branching, you should Show a survey and then click
to [Add Requirement] next to some question.

The system will interpret the requirements to mean that for some
question Q, it has a list of Options X such that it assumes all the
options are in one question and if the response to that question is in
X then question Q will be enabled, else it will be disabled.

When the user is filling out a survey, prototype will observe the
fields and appropriately show or hide questions.
